# My Personal Project

## A General Knowledge Quiz Application  

This application will present the user with 7 questions
where each question will have 4 options to choose from. 
Only one option out of these 4 options is correct and only choosing
this correct option will provide full credit to the user for that
question.  

The questions in this application will be based on general knowledge and will 
include the following topics:

- **Countries and their histories**
- **Sports facts and records**
- **Popular tourist destinations**

By using this application, users can get information about general knowledge and
will be able to test themselves about how much they are aware of different facts
and information. The project is particularly useful for kids as they will become
more aware about the world around them and will gain a deeper understanding of the
same.

**Reason for choosing this project**

By doing this project, I will get a better understanding of how Java can be used
to create something useful for the community that everyone can use, regardless 
of their age.

I chose this idea particularly because it involves challenging oneself to work
with different data structures of Java, like maps and their types, lists and their types, interfaces, loops and so on. This
project also has the potential to be converted into a graphical format with
interactivity which will be a very fulfilling learning experience.

## User Stories

- As a user, I want the questions in my quiz to be equally distributed amongst 
different topics without bias on a particular subject.
- As a user, I want all my answers to be stored as I answer the questions one by one
in a reliable location.
- As a user, I want to be able to answer all the questions in the quiz by 
selecting 1 option out of 4 options.
- As a user, I want to be able to see my result at the end of the quiz about how
many questions I got correct and where I stand.
- As a user, I want to be given the option of seeing all the questions and their 
answers at the end of the quiz.
- As a user, whenever I quit my application and run it again, I want to be given the 
option to load the answers to the questions from my previous attempt.
- As a user, when I select the option to load my answers, I want my previous answers
to be loaded and my new answers to be added to the file in addition to the
previous answers.
- As a user, if I don't select the option to load my answers from the 
previous attempt, I want my new attempt to be independent of the previous
attempt.
- As a user, I want the option to see my answers of the previous attempt
by loading them so that when I attempt the quiz again and forget to save
the answers, I will know which questions were wrong.

## Phase 4: Task 3:  
### Improvements I would make to my existing application in terms of design:  
My QuestionWindow class and Quiz class depends on a lot of other classes, 4 and 
3 respectively, to be specific and a change in any of these
classes would cause these classes to not work as per expectations, as a result of lack of 
cohesion and increased coupling. I would try to abstract some common behaviour to 
reduce the load on other classes.  
I have tried to apply the Single Responsibility Principle wherever I could but some
of my classes still carry out multiple tasks which is not a good design approach, so
I would try break down those classes into individual classes with single 
responsibilities.  
I would also like to make my application more robust by making my classes robust
and handling unexpected behaviour so that the application doesn't crash when 
something unexpected happens. Obviously, it is not possible to foresee all the
possible situations in which my application would fail, but I would like to give my classes
the ability to respond to such potential situations.
